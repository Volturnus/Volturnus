This is a pre-release version of the Volturnus IRCd config admin!
You'll probably want to take a look at the INSTALL file. It's not
much, but it should give you a general idea of how to set up
everything and get it working. If you can't, come talk to us on
IRC:

irc.volturnus.net #volturnus

IMPORTANT NOTE:
By default, the instant rehash bot is enabled. This is only really
useful if you are using remote includes. If you don't want it,
just comment it out in index.php. There's a note!

There are probably still a few bugs, so you may not want to use
this in the real world yet. This release is only intended as
a pre-release, so some of the development features have not
yet been implemented. There's plenty on the TODO list, so feel
free to come by and see where things stand.

If you find a bug, report it at:

http://www.e-cabi.net/bugs/

The following IRCds are being worked on and will be
released later:

InspIRCd 1.2
Charybdis 3.1
Ratbox 2.2
